Implemented IÂ²C protocol in Verilog HDL with master and slave finite state machines (FSMs).
Designed logic for start/stop conditions, address decoding, and bus arbitration.
Supported 7-bit addressing, read/write bit handling, and data transfer with acknowledgment.
Derived clock signals for master (200 kHz) and slave (400 kHz) from base 1 GHz clock.
Verified bidirectional communication and synchronization through simulation testbench.
Ensured protocol compliance with correct acknowledgment responses and reliable data exchange.
